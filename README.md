# H-Bridge Module

#### Project Overview

The H-Bridge Module project demonstrates how to control the direction and speed of a DC motor using an H-Bridge module with an Arduino Nano. This project is essential for building robotics projects, motorized vehicles, and various mechanical automation systems.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **H-Bridge Motor Driver Module**
3. **DC Motor**
4. **Power Source**
5. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect H-Bridge Module to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the PWM speed control pin (enA) of the H-Bridge module to pin 9 of the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the direction control pins (in1 and in2) of the H-Bridge module to pins 8 and 7 of the Arduino Nano, respectively.
   - Connect the power and ground pins of the H-Bridge module to an appropriate power source and ground.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the H-Bridge module to the Arduino Nano according to the circuit setup.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Select the appropriate board (Arduino Nano) and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, observe the DC motor's behavior based on the programmed directions and speeds.

#### Applications

- **Robotics Projects:** Control motors in robotic arms, wheels, and other robotic systems.
- **Motorized Vehicles:** Drive motors in RC cars, drones, and other remote-controlled vehicles.
- **Mechanical Automation:** Automate mechanical systems such as conveyor belts, gates, and doors.

#### Notes

- Ensure correct wiring and connection between the H-Bridge module and the Arduino Nano.
- Adjust motor speed and direction parameters in the code to match your specific application requirements.
- Use appropriate power sources and ratings to avoid damaging the motor or the H-Bridge module.
